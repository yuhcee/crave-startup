## Notes

The time was not enough for me to complete the whole logic and requirements as ideal as I wanted. However, I will further complete it on my own. 

You can view the completed project with proper styling, folder structure and complete logic on my repo [here](https://github.com/yuhcee/crave-startup)

Thanks!
